# Nested Content Experiment

Check it out on http://rachidmrad.com/moebius/


### Getting Started

To get started, simply clone the repository. 
While the concept is promising (I think), the prototype needs a lot of clean-up and some sort of deep-linking functionality. Workin' on it.

The prototype uses shadowAnimate.js to animate the drop shadows (http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/shadow-animation/) and greensock.js (http://greensock.com/) for everything else.
